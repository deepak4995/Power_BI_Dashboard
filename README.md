# Power_BI_Dashboard
As part of a hands-on project, I built an interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales dataâ€”from data connections to beautiful visualizations, it was a full journey of data transformation and storytelling.

Key Learnings:-
- Created dynamic dashboards for real-time insights into business performance.
- Used filters, slicers, and drill-downs for deeper data exploration.
- Joined and transformed datasets, created calculated columns & measures to enhance analysis.
- Designed various customized visualizations including bar, pie, donut, clustered bar, scatter, line, map charts, and more.
